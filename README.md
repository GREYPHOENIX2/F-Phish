#How to use

This tool is very easy to use 
but even for beginners but' if you're a script kiddie it might be a little hard to understand it


1.When you run the script you'll see the options(You'll have to enter an option twice)

2.After choosing the option the server will run

3.When it's running you'll see two hosts.The first Host is the localhost and the second one is the host you'll use to make the site accessible on the internet 

4.Now you can send the IP address to your victim.it's not an actual ip so it cannot be used to track you and it always changes

5.You can use a url shortener or a maskphish tool to hide the ip

6.Finally when the victim logs in on the site they will be redirected to the same site And you will get the credentials in the 'Credentials' Folder
